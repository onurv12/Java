# Rock Paper Scissors
  My first Java group project from the first semester.
  
## Rules
  - It can be played single or multi player. 
  - Both players have 4 Rocks, 4 Papers, 4 Scissors, 1 Bomb, 1 Flag.
  - Player sets his flag and his bomb either manually or by shuffling.
  - Then the player can swap his pieces freely until ready.
  - Bomb and Flag are immobile after game start.
  - The game starts when both players click ready. 
  - Initially opponent's pieces are visible only as a ghost.
  - Players move their pieces vertically or horizontally in a turn-based manner.
  - An encounter is initiated by moving pieces on opponent's pieces.
  - At an encounter Bomb beats all; Flag is beaten by all. Classic rules apply between other pieces.
  - In case of a draw a classic Rock-Paper-Scissors will begin (only digitally) until someone wins. 
     The winner's piece will transform into his last choice.
  - The goal is to get the opponent's Flag.
